# Steganographer
A project that I put together to do steganography in Python. It isn't perfect but it was interesting to work on.

# DISCLAIMER
I am not a proper cryptographer or anything of the sort. I am a regular guy who was interested in how steganography might be done. I did the best I could think of off the top of my head during some very long shifts at work with little to do. I am not responsible if you attempt to use this software to obscure/safeguard your data and it somehow results the data being compromised. If your data needs to be kept safe you should hire a proper professional, not somebody that has a slow job and an interest in programming. That being said, if this code can somehow benefit you then you are free to use it within limits of the MIT license.
